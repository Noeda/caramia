description:
    This is a highish-level OpenGL bindings library for real-time graphics for
    Haskell, with minimum OpenGL version being 2.1.
    .
    Requirements:
    .
    * GHC 7.8+
    * OpenGL 2.1 (with some extensions)
    .
    If the target system has OpenGL 3.3, then all features in this library should
    be available unless stated otherwise. This library provides functions to check
    if some particular feature is supported on the platform at run-time. OpenGL
    contexts with 3.x or later versions can be a core profile; this library does
    not care.
    .
    You need to use `-threaded` flag in executables that use this library.
    .
    Here are the most important features of this library:
    .
    * Safe and automatic finalization of OpenGL resources
    .
    * No implicit state (that is, no glBind* mess or equivalent). There is a
        monad for mass-rendering that has implicit state but the state is localized
        to running of that monad. (see Caramia.Render).
    .
    Here are some curious features that you might find useful.
    .
    * This library plays nice with other OpenGL libraries. It does not mess up
        the implicit OpenGL state (except for aforementioned rendering monad).
    .
    * This library does not create an OpenGL context. You can use whatever
        library you want to create an OpenGL context as long as it can get an
        OpenGL 2.1 (or any later version) context. You may be interested at looking
        at the tests in this package to see how to use this with the `sdl2`
        package.
    .
    * Operations are generalized over `MonadIO`. Works on top of pure `IO` and
        also in your custom monad stacks, if they have `MonadIO` at bottom.
    .
    (At least) the following OpenGL concepts are present in this library:
    .
    * Buffer objects (you can do low-level mapping and use raw pointers)
    .
    * Geometry, vertex and fragment shaders
    .
    * Indexed and non-indexed rendering
    .
    * Framebuffers
    .
    * Textures (with many topologies, 1D, 2D, 3D, texture arrays, cube textures;
        we also have buffer textures and multisampling textures)
    .
    * Vertex array objects
    .
    * Blending, stencil, depth and cull tests
    .
    * Instanced rendering
    .
    * Synchronization objects
    .
    * Query objects
    .
    Some notable missing features:
    .
    * Tesselation shaders. This is an OpenGL 4.x feature but we could add it.
    .
    * Using shaders with transform feedback.
    .
    * Multi-threaded rendering.
    .
    This library tries to avoid including obsolete or redundant features of OpenGL.
