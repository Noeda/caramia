This (hopefully) will be a Haskell library for using OpenGL in a more
convenient and safe way (as compared to existing higher-level OpenGL bindings
in Haskell).

The plan is to not make something revolutionary but to just let the relevant
(that is, modern, useful) parts of OpenGL to be used without too much
boilerplate or hassle in Haskell.

Read [the cabal file](caramia.cabal) for more information. Although as of
writing of this, it is very much outright lying to you what this Haskell
library can do.

Note: GHC 7.8 is required and it's not released at the time of writing of this.
